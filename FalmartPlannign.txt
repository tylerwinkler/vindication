***********************************************************************************************
NOTE: THERE WERE SEVERAL PARALLELS TO GAMES LIKE COOKIE CLICKER OR ADVENTURE CAPITALIST AND I WANT IT TO BE KNOWN THAT THIS GAME WILL NOT BE ONE OF THOSE. THOSE ARE LAME AND SERVE NO PURPOSE AS WELL AS OFFER NO (lol) MONETARY VALUE. THIS GAME IS VERY MUCH IN THE SAME VEIN AS EUROPA UNIVERSALIS, STEALLARIS, OR SIMCITY (except not stupid shitty server launch problems amirite). DO NOT SULLY THE EXCEPTIONAL IDEA WE HAVE WITH THIS SHIT.
***********************************************************************************************

Skills:
Everyone starts with a 0/100 in a skill when they are higher, unless previous work experience would increase the level (arbitrarily assigned).
Employees would be promoteable to new positions as needed/created and their levels would remain.
Management gain traits upon promotion and possibly improve these traits as they "level up". Outside hires of "professional managers" come with a trait already determined.
Management are the only traited workers - makes them a superior asset.
MAYBE EVERYONE HAS TRAITS AND MANAGMENT GET A SPECIAL MANAGEMENT TRAIT.

Structure:
The store is structured as a singular body with numerous departments of the whole body. I.e. provinces within a country on an rts.
The store will begin with only a couple core departments.
At start of game the player is allowed to choose which type of store to start with: either Grocery or GM. These will have about 3 related starting departments.
Additional depaartments can be added by first researching it then paying to add it (construction and initial set up).
Stores will also include "back-of-house offices" to influence policies and what not.
The research office DOES NOT start in either version of the beginning store. It can be built without research but costs money and "expansion construction" time like all others will.

"Back-of-house" offices (BOH):
The store will include additional back-of-house offices which will fulfill the role of admin, Invoice, Receiving, Personnel, and others.
These offices will provide bonuses and additional passive effects.
One office will be utilized for research (not sure which office atm).

Research:
The research BOH office will be one that costs money to utilize but researches new things for the store. It will have 3 trees. Structure, Operations, Personnel. And these trees will have different branches of research that flow in an intuitive way path.
Structure will research new departments including store expansions and BOH departments. This will also include researches for new "classifications" of your store. Mom and Pop shop to grocery store to supercenter - possibly on to corporation depending on how that is handled.
Operations will unlock new policies that will improve efficiency or reduce cost or other passive improvements to the store. (Some policies could go beyond passive improvements to a more interactive addition. No clear thought on this yet.)
Personnel will unlock employee specific researches. One branch can be a management specific tree which may include unlocking additional management slots for hire. Same for hourly employees. OR the hire quantities could be in their own branch or as seperate free floating branches. Depends on how we structure the flow. If it makes sense to limit hiring behind a progressive "unlock tree" then they will be locked within a branch.

Story/Flow:
Start off as a small "mom and pop" of 1 of 2 types (Grocery or GM). You get to grow and expand as your profits and success allows. As you hit new "classifciations" your store is restructured and you gain new benefits/deficiencies. 
END GAME/NEXT PHASE
Eventually you can reach a point in time where you can incorporate (via research) and/or you can franchise. We could have a split in the tree where you choose to incorporate or franchise or we can have franchising in a later research within incorporation. 
Franchising will offer limited control and a monthly cost but also yields income (assuming profitability and based on their success - which is something that can be influenced by your limited control). Think Sectors from Stellaris.
Incorporation can/will add a new level of gameplay ('expansion' level change).
It will open up stock markets, investments, investors, competition from additional (and often larger) corps.

Control:
You will play as the founder and store manager of the Falmart(?) store.
You will have direct control of hiring and managing of every position/department.
As you reach new stages in the stores progress you will gain more higher level concerns but also more of your previous tasks will become automated - with the option to handle them yourself.
You hire employees initially then personnel (requires research) will handle it with varying degrees of success when youre busy.
You assign employees to different departments/roles. You also get to choose who to promote or hire management from outside sources in a special list of professional managers applications (this will have a negative to encourage promotion with the store - either extremely high signing bonus or significantly higher yearly salary or some sort of block to their performance).
Here are the two consistent, ever present interactive compontents of the game. Early on, these tasks will be required to be done by the player - there wont be anyone else to do them but with progress and research a department/role will exist to manage these to an acceptable (affected by stats/buffs/researches) level innately. The player will always have the option to control these aspects. These tasks will be RETURNS/DAMAGES and FEATURES.
Additonally random events will occur that have positive and negative affects.

Random Events:
Events occur and offer a range of 1+ choices of how to handle them. Someone quits: 1 option - accept it. Electric jack breaks: 4 choices - Pay a lot to fix it, pay a little to fix it and take an efficiency hit for some time, dont pay to fix it and take an extended efficiency hit, or let your in-house team fix it (50/50 shot it works or you have to buy a whole new one). 
With these events - think very much the approach Stellaris takes to random events.
They can run the gammut in type and severity.
****Possibly even include specific significant events that can occur. In EU4 if you (and all other nations) allow religious turmoil to grow unabated then eventually the Protestant Reformation happens (a historical event) to the whole world. This could be done simillarly in Falmart if we added something like EPA regulations or the Consumer Bill of Rights if your public opinion gets too low (number of refused refunds are too high). These may be too much to worry about initially.
 
RETURNS/DAMAGES:
this will be a glossy look atm. Occasionally occur (based on chance - research and what not can affect the severity of these (probably not the rate of occurence because they provide interactive gameplay)). Purchases will be returned (a slider can be set to set a required value for it to be brought to the attention of you, the manager. Anything below a specific price point will be resolved automatically). You can view the item, the total, and the reason for return and decide if it is a return you will allow. If you allow it, you lose a portion of the sale amount as a "handle/restocking/because-I-fucking-said-so" fee (discourages just simply accepting the return without real judgement - possibly adds a public opinion buff) or you can choose to refuse the return and you keep the money but take some kind of negative affect/hit (possibly only take a negative hit if you refuse a return that seems "just" and if you accept an "unjust" return you can reap the benefits of a positve boost (public perception?)
***Note maybe 2 kinds of events - Just and Unjust. If a refund is Just and you accept the refund you lose money but no benefit - if you refuse, you keep the money but take an opinion hit. If the refund is Unjust and you accept it you get a boost but lose money - if you refuse, you take no opinion malus and keep the money (no gain-no loss).***

FEATURES:
Features will be the biggest part of making money for your store. Just like our jobs, features will be an opportunity to capitalize on hit items to earn extra profits. Each department will have a couple of Endcaps and Stackbases (stackbases will have a bonus more than endcaps). When you click on the endcap it will bring up a form. The form will have a few options (3-4?) with details about pricing vs cost. It could possibly show past sales (maybe too easy). It will be offers from different suppliers with the cost for the feature quantity (they will offer good discounts to convince you to buy - worse item = better discount, better item = worse discount::risk vs reward). You will get to plan these features (in advance to allow for the speed of the game, cant get all the features in just a few minutes). You will get thematic(sp?) bonuses if they align so they would have to weigh their choices of better deal vs better alignment. Researches will affect deals that are offered and ability to advertise/present items. Additionally, you can spend money to advertise your features (choose which one) or make a general ad in papers/tv. Costs money or some other possible resource and provides a bonus to either those 2-3 specific features (out of all the ones in the whole store so gotta weigh which is worth it) or a bonus to the whole stores feature freight. Additionally, strong (or weak) performing features could affect foot-traffic in the store and possibly convey a boon to sales elsewhere.

Hiring:
At the start, you will staff your store with people you chose to hire. You will be presented with a number of "applications" available at any given time to refer to when you need to hire employees (no bonus apps at start but enough to fill the store - realistic 'you get what you get' for a new business). The number and quality of these application will be based on your businesses success/public perception (both influenced by researches and how you run the store). The applications will show you 2 main/performance affecting bits of information for the applicant: Personality and History. 
History will affect starting skill levels.
Personality will affect the traits an employee will gain upon promotion and also influence how well they work, how often they are unproductive or wasting time, and how good (or bad) their customer service is.
Employee personalities can cause work place disputes that will be displayed as a notification on the "map" and a debuff to the department. 
Certain personalities can offer an synergy to others to add a buff to the department (as will 'verteran' employees) while others may have no affect or offer debuffs.
