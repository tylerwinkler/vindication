Start by getting a Bank Loan that needs repaying.
Initial size/departments = Dry Grocery, Produce, Frozen/Dairy, Meat. 
*More options possible. Grocery start (high ff, high, C%, low ATS); GM start (low ff, low C%, high ATS).

Minimum Viable Product:
Department(s), customers, employees, sales.

4 major factors to sales: Footfall, conversion %, average ticket size.

ATS * Footfall * Conversion = Sales

Customers = Footfall
Employees = Conversion %
Departments = ATS

Departments provide a fixed boost to footfall, possible conversion penalty, and set the ATS.

Dry Grocery:	+30 ff/h, ATS = $30, C% = .85 FCOV = .4 GMCOV = .3	= $1275/h; $17850/d
Produce:	+20 ff/h, ATS = $15, C% = .60 FCOV = .5	GMCOV = .3	= $378/h; $5292/d
Meat:		+ 7 ff/h, ATS = $30, C% = .60 FCOV = .5	GMCOV = .3	= $126/h; $1764/d
Frozen/Dairy:	+12 ff/h, ATS = $25, C% = .60 FOCV = .5	GMCOV = .3	= $180/h; $2520/d
*Based on 14 hour calculation
Time of day will affect footfall. Increase/Decrease in footfall but minor increase in Conversion.

Crossover Effect for Footfall
Food Crossover Value (FCOV) = crossover effect for food side foot traffic (food side will be higher)
GM Crossover Value (GMCOV) = crossover effect for GM side foot traffic (food side will be lower)
